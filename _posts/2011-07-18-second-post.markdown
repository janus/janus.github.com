I learnt basic programming skill while going through htdp book. It helped the so much that after reading more than half of the book, I started checking out other languages.One of the languages I took to my heart is Clojure, it was possible for me to get along with FP and Clojure because of the help I got from htpd book. Clojure was the first language I dared to check out its source code. And that was indeed a good exercise. From there I started reading a lot in the area of FP stuff. However, it took a real long time before I picked my way with macro. I have all this while tried out a lot languages not seriously checking them out but to see and get one or two things. However, I have decided to spend my time with SICP. I know it going to be tasking and challenging. It would drive me to my extreme, but if I manage to get to the end it would be a wonderful exercise which will influence my coding style for decades to come. I have almost finished chapter one. But it found that it covered so much. It is a book on its own. From Dynamic programming to divide-and-conquer. Even RSA was introduced....... Clearly this chapter is loaded and interesting... It introduced  abstract/compound functions and it even shows the even why it is show. SICP used Scheme which is FP, however one is not meant to learn Scheme here in order to get along. I am doing my excercise using Clojure. I could have also used Python. The choice is yours.
I feel that the aim of SICP is not to teach one how to program , but to develop one to think like a computer scientist. I would spend the rest of this week trying to see if I could finish chapter one and migrate to chapter two. 

From what I have cover... JavaScript ways of encapsulating and abstracting is pretty covered in this book.
