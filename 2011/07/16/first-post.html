<h1>Time to learn Assembly Language</h1>
<p>In the past I found it extremely hard to find my way within assembly language. Lately, I stumbled upon a course on compiler which is and area I have'
been longing to study. While going through the course material... I immediately found that I need to have some assembly in order to get through with the course. Being infinitely lazy, I decided to abandon the course and move on. However, I along the way I checked out System programming course.Hmm, I met Assembly again. Finally, I just decided to check it out.
I was amazed by what when I found that when it comes to characters/string manipulation that Assembly used the natural means. That means that I need not worry
myself too much. I was able to create C'c equivalent of strcopy , title case , and other funny stuff. I enjoyed Assembly so much that I devoted time learning it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="gas"><span class="nf">movl</span> <span class="no">$0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span>
<span class="nf">xol</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">%eax</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Started making sense.. I enjoyed the way stack is manipulated in Assembly language. It is pure Turing....</p>

<p>When I started seeing things like</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="gas"><span class="nf">pushl</span> <span class="nv">%ebp</span>
<span class="nf">movl</span> <span class="nv">%esp</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">%ebp</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Or</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="gas"><span class="nf">movl</span> <span class="nv">%ebp</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">%esp</span>
<span class="nf">popl</span> <span class="nv">%ebp</span>
<span class="nf">ret</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I felt at home...</p>

<p>This will be the best blog ever Good.</p>
